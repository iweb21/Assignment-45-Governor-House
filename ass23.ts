// 23.write a series of	Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//console.log(car == 'subaru')
//• Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
//• Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and and another 5 tests evaluate to false.


let myCar = "Alto";
console.log(myCar == "Alto");

// 10 statement true / false

   let myFruit = "Apple";
   console.log(myFruit == "Alto");

   let myArray = [13,3,9];
   console.log(myArray.length == 3);
   console.log(myArray.length == 4);

   let stdName = "Ali";
   console.log(stdName == "Ali");
   console.log(stdName == "ali");

   let mySchool = "Government";
   console.log(mySchool == "Government");
   console.log(mySchool === "private");

   let lang = "urdu";
   console.log(lang == "urdu");
   console.log(lang === "english")
